Explanation
Model and Tokenizer Setup: deepseek_model.py initializes the model and tokenizer.
Agent Class: enhanced_bot_structure.py defines the Agent class and methods for generating training data.
Training Function: task_distribution.py defines the training function and dataset.
Bot Orchestrator: enhanced_orchestrator.py defines the BotOrchestrator and AutonomousBot classes.
Specialized Phone Bots: phone_bots.py defines specialized bots for file management, network control, UI navigation, and data processing.
Main Script: enhanced_main.py ties everything together, initializes the system, and executes a sample task.
This structured approach ensures that all components are integrated cohesively, allowing for a modular and extensible system.

How to install
To install the required dependencies for your project, you should create a requirements.txt file listing all the necessary packages. Then, you can use pip to install them. Here are the steps:

Step 1: Create a requirements.txt File
Create a file named requirements.txt with the following content:

txt
numpy
random
torch
transformers
Step 2: Install the Dependencies
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory. Then, run the following command to install all the dependencies listed in requirements.txt:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3: Verify Installation
To verify that the packages are installed correctly, you can try importing them in a Python script or an interactive Python session:

Python
import numpy as np
import random
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

print("All packages are installed correctly.")
If you see no errors and the message "All packages are installed correctly." is printed, then the installation was successful.

Additional Notes
Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from python.org.
If you are using a virtual environment, activate it before running the pip install command.
If you have any specific installation issues or questions about the environment, feel free to ask!
